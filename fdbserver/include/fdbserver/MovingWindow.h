// MovingWindow::addSample() will sum up all the samples, and getAverage() method will return the average
// sampling rate in the past <timeWindow>, where every sample weights evenly.
// A use case for MovingWindow is the "BytesWrittenAverageRate" in "MovingData" Trace, where we
// want to get the actual average bytes moved rate by DD in the past DD_TRACE_MOVE_BYTES_AVERAGE_INTERVAL. We would have
// a sense of how many bytes DD moved recently and it will help us get to know DD workload.
// Comparison with Smoother: if you want to use a recency-based weighting(i.e. less important if sampled long time ago)
// Smoother(which uses an exponential function for smoothing) woule be a good choice. On the other hand, if you want to
// know the average sample rates in the last <timeWindow>, MovingWindow might be better.
